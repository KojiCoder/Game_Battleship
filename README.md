# Game_Battleship
My attempt coding the popular board game Battleship using C++.

In this game that I have coded, there are many features that were added.
For instance:
  -different colors that's displayed for miss and hits
  -notify player when they destroy a ship
  -different board size
  -3 levels of difficulty
